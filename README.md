# Pyber_Analysis
## Project Overview
At PyBer, we were given a large data flie to analyze, with the goal of gaining insights into the company and its riders. We broke the data down by the types of the city, and looked at the number of drivers, average fare, total fares collected, total rides, and the average fare collected by drivers. We collected this information in a data frame, and then made a chart displaying the fares collected in each city week by week.

## Resources
Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

Software used: Python 3.8.8, Anaconda 4.10.3, Jupyter Notebook, Virtual Studio Code Version: 1.57.0

## Results
### Analysis

In the below chart we can see the monthly fares from January through April, for each city types Rural, Suburban, and Urban. The chart clearly shows that, unsuprisingly, more fares were collected from Urban rides than either Suburban or Rural rides. We also found that there were significantly more rides in Urban cities than the other two categories. There were 1,625 urban rides, 625 suburban rides, and only 125 rides in rural cities. We also saw that while the volume was higher for Urban cities, the average fare in Urban cities was lower than both Suburban and Rural citites. The average ride was $24.53 in urban cities, $30.97 in suburban cities, and $34.62 in rural cities. This data is displayed below and will be in our analysis folder as well.

## Summary
After our analysis, we can clearly see that Urban rides generated the most revenue due to having the highest ride volume and the highest number of drivers. PyBer should try and encourage more people in Rural and Suburban areas to drive for PyBer. Increasing the number of drivers and variety of rides available (XL, a luxury offering, etc) will expand the pool of available rides to local customers. PyBer should also increase advertising in these areas to encourage more people to use their app for rides. Finally, PyBer should try and target areas where more people will need rides in those suburban and rural markets to increase ridership. Places like regional airports, bus or train stations, bars, and nightclubs are all venues where people often need taxis and PyBer can step in to fill that need.
